# Portfolio Website From Figma

This is a personal portfolio website I created based on a Figma community design by [SaulDesign](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1175755450846438274/portfolio-website-design). I used **Tailwind CSS**, **Vanilla JS**, and **HTML** to bring the design to life with a few customizations and added features.

## Features

- **Buy Me A Coffee Button:** Instead of a 'Download CV' button, I added a 'Buy Me A Coffee' button for those who want to support me.
- **Scroll-to-Top Button:** A scroll-to-top button has been added to make navigation easier on longer pages.
- **Footer:** A footer was added with links to my social media profiles and other relevant resources.

## Built With

- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** Used for dynamic functionality, such as filtering portfolio items and adding smooth scroll behavior.
- **HTML:** The structure and layout of the website.
